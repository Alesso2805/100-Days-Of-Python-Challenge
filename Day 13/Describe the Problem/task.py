# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#the i loop is iteratin in the range from 1 to 19, not including 20
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# when the for loop reaches 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# i should go through 20 in the for loop to be printed
